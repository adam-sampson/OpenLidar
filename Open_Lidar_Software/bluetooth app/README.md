# Bluetooth App

The attached zip file contains an app from http://www.jnhuamao.cn/index_en.asp?ID=1 that allows for connecting to an HM-10 device in windows 10 64 bit. 

This app is required because the BLE device does not get it's own port assigned to it as other non-BLE modules do. 

To install the app follow the instructions in the README inside the zip file. Then find it in your program files just like any other app.
