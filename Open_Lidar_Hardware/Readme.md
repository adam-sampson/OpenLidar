# Open Lidar Hardware

This section includes the 3d models required to print the body of the Lidar.

# Current iteration

The current iteration assumes that the lidar will be 3D printed. It is recommended that the model be printed in PETG, Nylon, or ABS for the thermal resistance and strength properties. 

# Status

Design Mode. This project is still actively being designed. A final design has not been printed/verified yet.
